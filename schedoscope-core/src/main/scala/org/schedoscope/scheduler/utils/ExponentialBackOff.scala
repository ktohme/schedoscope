  * Implementing Exponential Back-off Algorithm
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff
  *
  * @param backOffSlotTime the time value of a slot; in wikipedia network example, this would be the 51.2 microseconds
  * @param backOffSlot     counter for exponential growth; in wikipedia example, this would be the collisions count
  * @param backOffWaitTime the actual waiting time for a given iteration
  * @param constantDelay   add, optionally, variant to algorithm to allow guarantee of minimum delay > 0
  * @param ceiling         optionally define an upper limit for the max number of collisions multiplier
  * @param resetOnCeiling  reset algorithm collision count if ceiling reached
  * @param retries         counter for number of retries/collisions occurred
  * @param resets          counter for number of times ceiling was reached
  * @param totalRetries    counter of absolute total retries, independently of resets
